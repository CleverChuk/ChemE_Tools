# ChemE_Tools
<p>
  Thanks for checking out this repo, most of the codes is not well commented as of yet! I'm still working on it and trying to get them to
  work perfectly to solve those problems. If you're MatLab proficient you shouldn't have any problem using it. I also have excel files that 
  does other stuff that I didn't try coding with Matlab. I will be abstracting everything into MatLab as time goes on.
