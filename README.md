# ChemE_Tools
  
> Thanks for checking out this repo. It contains programs and excel sheets to solve Chemical Engineering Thermodynamic and Material and
  Energy Balance problems. Most of the codes is not well commented as of yet! I'm still working on it and trying to get them to
  work perfectly to solve those problems. If you're MatLab proficient you shouldn't have any problem using it. I also have excel files that does other stuff that I didn't try coding with Matlab. I will be abstracting everything into MatLab as time goes on.


###### These codes and excel sheets are free to use and modify! Please make sure you read the software licence!

#### Usage:

> open up Matlab
> Make sure the implemented folder is the current directory
> run rootCaller.m
